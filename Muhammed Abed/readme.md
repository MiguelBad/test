Cooking websites design

Problem Context

Our cooking website aims to provide a platform for users to share, discover, and engage with recipes. However, we have identified a challenge in motivating users to actively participate in recipe exploration and adoption. We have observed that the example product/service website similar to our goal lack efficient filtering options based on key factors such as preparation time, allergens, dietary requirements, and cooking skill levels. This limitation hampers users' ability to discover relevant recipes tailored to their specific preferences and constraints

Furthermore, there is a perception among users that recipes created or endorsed by professional chefs are of higher quality, more trustworthy, or more appealing compared to recipes shared by non-professionals or amateurs. However, the current lack of user engagement and recipe adoption on our platform poses a risk to its sustainability and growth. Without addressing these issues, we may fail to capitalize on the potential of user-generated content and risk losing users to competitors offering curated content.

How might we design and optimize our cooking website to enhance user engagement, encourage recipe adoption, and improve user experience and satisfaction through robust filtering mechanisms based on factors such as prep time, allergens, dietary requirements, and cooking skill?

Goal

We aim to redesign and develop a cooking website to provide users with an intuitive, personalised, and accessible culinary experience. The website aims to address the following user needs and expectations:

Easy navigation and search functionality for finding recipes quickly.

Personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.

Mobile responsiveness for seamless across devices.

High-quality multimedia content, including videos, images and step-by-step instructions.

Design Inspirations

Technologies to be Used

Front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user experience.

Backend development: python and API development.

Trollo: Used for visual project management and task tracking.

Jira: Used for comprehensive project management, issue tracking, and agile development.

Bitbucket: Used for version control, collaborative software development and hosting git or mercurial repositories.

Key Features to Implement

User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and search functionality.

Personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences, dietary restrictions and browsing history.

Mobile responsiveness for optimal viewing experience on smartphones and tablets.

Integration of multimedia content such as videos, images and step-by-step recipe instructions.

User authentication and profile management to save favourite recipes and customise preferences.

Accessibility enhancements include screen reader support, keyboard shortcuts, and text resizing options.

Project Improvement

Promote healthy eating habits with nutritional information and meal planning.
Continuously optimise the platform based on user feedback and analytics.

Hypothesis
Users who visit cooking sites with user-generated content will be likelier to attempt recipes than those who visit cooking websites with content curated by professional chefs.
