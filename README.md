Cooking websites design

Problem Context

Australia is no stranger when it comes to high prices in food places. Reports by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reveal that there has been a decrease in the inflation rate from December 2022 to December 2023 (ABS, 2024). This gives Australians more reason to prepare their own food at home. In this modern age, a cooking website is the preferred way of accessing recipes. However, many existing cooking websites lack intuitive navigation, personalized content, and accessibility features, limiting their usability for diverse users, including those with disabilities. There is a need for a cooking website that offers a seamless user experience, personalized recommendations, and inclusive design to cater to the needs of all users.


Goal

1.	We aim to redesign and develop a cooking website to provide users with an intuitive, personalised, and accessible culinary experience. The website aims to address the following user needs and expectations:

2.	Easy navigation and search functionality for finding recipes quickly.

3.	Personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.

4.	Mobile responsiveness for seamless across devices.

5.	High-quality multimedia content, including videos, images and step-by-step instructions.


Design Inspirations

1.	What technologies currently are being used across the domain? 

    - Front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user experience.

    - Backend development: python and API development.

    - Trollo: Used for visual project management and task tracking.

    - Jira: Used for comprehensive project management, issue tracking, and agile development.
    
    - Bitbucket: Used for version control, collaborative software development and hosting git or mercurial repositories.


2.	How might technology be used ?

3.	How can technology integrate people and the domain?  

4.	How can technology help people improve in the domain?


Hypothesis
Users who visit cooking sites with user-generated content will be likelier to attempt recipes than those who visit cooking websites with content curated by professional chefs.
