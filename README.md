Project Breif

Problem Context
Australia is no stranger when it comes to high prices in food places. Reports by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reveal that there has been a decrease in the inflation rate from December 2022 to December 2023 (ABS, 2024). This gives Australians more reason to prepare their own food at home. In this modern age, a cooking website is the preferred way of accessing recipes. However, many existing cooking websites lack intuitive navigation, personalized content, and accessibility features, limiting their usability for diverse users, including those with disabilities. There is a need for a cooking website that offers a seamless user experience, personalized recommendations, and inclusive design to cater to the needs of all users.

Your Goal
What do you think the user wants/what will you provide

Design Inspirations

1.	What technologies currently are being used across the domain? 

2.	How might technology be used ?

3.	How can technology integrate people and the domain?  

4.	How can technology help people improve in the domain?


Hypothesis
Users who visit cooking websites with user-generated content will be more likely to attempt recipes compared to users who visit cooking websites with content curated by professional chefs.
