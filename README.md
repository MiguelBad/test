Project Brief
-------------

This website aims to create a responsive and visually appealing cooking website that provides recipes, cooking tips, and any additional information, as well as having relevant information about the team and how to contact them within the site itself. The project aims to target home cooks, food enthusiasts, or simply individuals seeking culinary inspiration on matters of recipes they are unfamiliar with. The website also offers the following features:

1. Easy navigation and search functionality for finding recipes quickly.
2. Personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.
3. Mobile responsiveness for seamless across devices.
4. High-quality multimedia content, including images and step-by-step instructions.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be the main building block for our website, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly interface for the users, as well as ensuring compatability across browsers and mobile devices. Each team member will run the website independently on private computers to identify faults before pushing them to the primary repository.

Team members will utilize Microsoft Teams and Bitbucket for effective feedback on changes and errors encountered while testing or found afterwards. Moreover, all team members will contribute equally to design, content creation, and development of code. The team also plans to meet regularly on a semi-weekly basis when needed and communicate via teams for any further updates
