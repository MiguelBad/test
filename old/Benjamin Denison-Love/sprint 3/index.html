    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>350g (12 oz) spaghetti</li>
          <li>500g (1 lb) ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork)</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
          <li>1 celery stalk, finely chopped</li>
          <li>1 can (400g/14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
          <li>1 bay leaf</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
          <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>

      <p><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong></p>
      <ol>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet. Break it up with a spoon and cook until it's browned and no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
          <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, basil, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened and the flavors have melded together. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a splash of water or beef broth to loosen it up.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Cook the Spaghetti:</strong></p>
      <ol>
          <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until it's al dente. Drain the spaghetti and set aside, reserving a little bit of the pasta cooking water.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Combine the Sauce and Spaghetti:</strong></p>
      <ol>
          <li>Remove the bay leaf from the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
          <li>Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the sauce. Toss everything together until the spaghetti is well coated in the sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it up.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Serve:</strong></p>
      <ul>
          <li>Divide the spaghetti Bolognese among serving plates. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
          <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Feel free to adjust the seasoning and ingredients according to your taste preferences. Spaghetti Bolognese is often served with a side of garlic bread or a simple green salad. Enjoy your meal!</p>

      <h3>Donut Gem Suprise</h3>
      <img src="recipe 2.jpg" alt="recipe2">
      <p>This recipe is a little different from the usual recipes one would have. This is what some would call a "stone meal". Something to eat when you just want something in you, but you are also not in the mood to actually care what it looks like.</p>
      <p>You will notice the image for this recipe isn't actually what this recipe looks like when finished, but rather it is a white bowl with a black mass with the words "Redacted" within it, this is because I do not know what this actually looks like. I make this meal in pitch blackness, never looking upon my creation, only tasting it.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <li>1 12-pack Coles cinnamon donuts</li>
            <li>1 2kg bag of potato gems</li>
            <li>Butter (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Cook the potato gems in the airfryer for about 8-10 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Shake the basket halfway through cooking for even crisping.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, carefully remove the potato gems from the airfryer and set them aside on a serving plate or tray.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Prepare the Cinnamon Donut Potato Gem Surprise:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take one cinnamon donut and cut it in half horizontally.</li>
            <li>If you would like to soften the inside of the donut and make yourself feel better about yourself, you can spread some butter on the insides of the donut, so that you feel like you are having a sandwich</li>
            <li>Place the bottom half of the cinnamon donut on top of a serving of potato gems.</li>
            <li>Top the bottom half with the top half of the cinnamon donut, creating a sandwich with the potato gems nestled in between.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process with the remaining cinnamon donuts and potato gems until you have made the desired number of servings.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Serve:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve your Airfryer Cinnamon Donut Potato Gem Surprise immediately while the donuts are still warm and the potato gems are crispy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feel free to adjust the serving size according to your preference, and enjoy your delicious creation!</p>
