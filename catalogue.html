                Instructions:<br>
                1. Heat half of the vegetable oil in a large flameproof baking dish over medium-high heat.<br>
                2. Cook the sliced mushrooms in the heated oil, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until just starting to soften.<br>
                3. Add rice vinegar and 1 1/2 tablespoons of ABC Sweet Soy Sauce to the mushrooms. Cook for 1 minute or until mushrooms are just tender.<br>
                4. Transfer the cooked mushrooms and sauce to a heatproof bowl. Set aside.<br>
                5. Heat the remaining vegetable oil in the same dish.<br>
                6. Cook the finely chopped onion in the heated oil for 2-3 minutes or until starting to soften.<br>
                7. Add crushed garlic and 90-second white long grain rice to the dish. Cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant.<br>
                8. Combine crumbled vegetable stock cube and boiling water in a medium jug. Add to the rice mixture along with the remaining sweet soy sauce. Stir to combine.<br>
                9. Add frozen peas to the dish. Bring to the boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens and rice starts to catch on the bottom of the dish.<br>
                10. Stir in half of the cooked mushrooms (excluding the sauce) into the rice mixture.<br>
                11. Preheat the grill on high heat.<br>

                13. Grill the dish for 3-4 minutes or until the mushrooms start to char slightly on the edges.<br>
                14. Serve the rice bake drizzled with extra sweet soy sauce and sprinkled with fresh coriander sprigs.<br>
