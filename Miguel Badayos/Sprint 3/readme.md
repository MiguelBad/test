Project Brief
-------------

Our cooking website aims to provide a platform for users to share, discover, and engage with recipes. However, we have identified a challenge in motivating users to actively participate in recipe exploration and adoption. We have observed that the example product/service website like our goal lack efficient filtering options based on key factors such as preparation time, allergens, dietary requirements, and cooking skill levels. This limitation hampers users' ability to discover relevant recipes tailored to their specific preferences and constraints.
 
Furthermore, there is a perception among users that recipes created or endorsed by professional chefs are of higher quality, more trustworthy, or more appealing compared to recipes shared by non-professionals or amateurs. However, the current lack of user engagement and recipe adoption on our platform poses a risk to its sustainability and growth. Without addressing these issues, we may fail to capitalize on the potential of user-generated content and risk losing users to competitors offering curated content.

The website aims to provide users a platform where users can share their recipe with others and discover new  recipes themselves. The creators of the website would also like to foster engagement and motivation for both beginners and experienced cooks. This can be done by providing users with an intuitive, personalised, and accessible culinary experience by:

1. Easy navigation and search functionality for finding recipes quickly.
2. Personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.
3. Mobile responsiveness for seamless across devices.
4. High-quality multimedia content, including videos, images and step-by-step instructions.

Design Inspirations
-------------------

The technologies that are being used across the domain in terms of the front-end development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of these websites also uses libraries, frameworks, or techniques such as React, Vue, Bootstrap, and Tailwind, Ajax, WordPress, and jQuery for their website. In terms of the back-end development, ASP.NET and WordPress were used in some of the websites.

These technologies used by other cooking websites can be used a guide for building our own website. Generally, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be the main building block for our website, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly interface for the users. Some frameworks like Bootstraps can also be used for the interface of the website. Moreover, using JavaScript and Ajax can help users easily filter and find recipes based on their likings and preferences. These technologies also allows user-generated reviews, comments, and ratings, fostering user engagement and constructive criticism. 

Business Assumptions
--------------------

Creators of the website believes that the  users have a need to find recipes that they can cook on their own homes, may it be from the available ingridients they already have at home, for an event, specific dietary needs, and more. These needs can be solved by developing a use-friendly website that provides features that allows easy navigation and filtering of recipes based on the user's needs. Moreover, these needs can also be solved by having personalised recipe recomnmendations based on user preferences and past behaviours.

The initial users of the websites would be members of the family that prepare food for their family, generally mothers and fathers of the family. However, the website also considers targetting young professionals or stutends that are interested in easy-to-cook recipes. According to Lindner (2023), in the Us '65% of Gen Z's' showed an interest in cooking as of 2021.


3.	My initial users are (use data):
4.	The main value a user wants to get out of my website is
5.	They can also get these additional benefits:
6.	I will acquire most of my users through (marketing)
7.	My primary competition in the market is
8.	We will be better because
9.	We will know we are successful when we see the following changes in user behaviour
10.	What other assumptions do we have that if proven false will cause our business/project to fail:
User Assumptions  to create personas
1.	Who is the user?
2.	Where does our product/website fit in their work or life? 
3.	What problems does our product/ website solve?
4.	When and how is our product website / used?
5.	What features are important? 
6.	How should our product/ website look and behave
Then explain IN DETAIL how these led to your persona  (one per individual). Provide persona with description

Hypothesis statement or user stories – list these
We believe ……. [this statement is true].
We will know we’re [right/wrong] when we see the following feedback from the [market] 
[qualitative feedback]   
[quantitative feedback]
[key performance indicator change]  
Your Component design

MVP 
Provide an outline of your first MVP. This is your individual ideas, not the team MVP yet, but you will combine these to form the entire site. So submit your own work
Information Architecture
What information will your MVP have. How will this be laid out, what pages will relate to other pages, what will be on what menu. We want a diagram showing at least 10 pages/cards/sections of a page, of different information that the users will be provided. Show how these parts relate eg by  
This is not the interactions, just the hierarchy or layout of the information.
For those doing games this will be the levels in the game or the steps in one level of the game so more the interaction design, what steps can be taken after other steps, etc. This may be a pattern that repeats across the game
