things to consider:

1. make  "please specify" text input required when 'others' option is ticked
OR
make it dynamically appear/disappear when 'others' is ticked

2. make a 'successfully submitted' html as well. use  js to say smth like 'ty <user's name>', form submitted on <time> etc

3. Automatically make capitalise each starting letter of input

4. When submitted but there are other inputs required that are not filled, highlight them in red

5. Dynamically give user a way to tell where are the required input and this will drop when filled

6. add different type of forms - use tab style ??

7. try to add international number options

8. when user accidentally clicked refresh, reset, close, submit, show a prompt

9. allowed document types (pdf, docs)

10. add a save function??

11. add rte on inputs??
